Stylesheet for Firefox to make it look better

## Detailed description

I tried creating my own `userChrome.css` and this is how it came out:



If you like a different color than the one I chose, you can always adjust the
style. All the colors I used are set in `:root` which is located at the top of
the file.

I went for a minimalist look, with open tabs and a search bar in one
bar, and I think it's so good.
