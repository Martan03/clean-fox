# Clean Fox

Stylesheet for Firefox to make it look better

## Description

I tried creating my own `userChrome.css` and this is how it came out:

If you like a different color than the one I chose, you can always adjust the
style. All the colors I used are set in `:root` which is located at the top of
the file.

I went for a minimalist look, with open tabs and a search bar in one
bar, and I think it's so good. Normally it just takes so much space.

This style will definitely evolve over time as I find problems or come up
with a good idea to make it even better.

## Suggestion

I recommend using [BetterFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox),
which solves some of the privacy issues. Firefox collects some data about you
when you browse the web, and this `user.js` fixes that as well with some other
nice tweaks. You can read more on the repo page.

If you like this style, you can also use
[my VSCode theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Martan03.kumuhana)
that uses similar design options.

## Installation

1. Go to About Profiles page (type `about:profile` to search bar)
2. Find the profile you use and click `Open Directory` button next to the
`Root Directory`. This should open a file explorer
3. Create new folder called `chrome` and navigate to the created folder
4. Paste `userChrome.css` that you downloaded from this repo
5. Start Firefox and enjoy!
